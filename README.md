<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We present the design and development of a serious game in Unity 3D about climate change, taking into consideration the effects it has on people.
We implement personalisation by developing a Python tool that starts from a given set of questionnaires. Additionally we took in consideration some catasrophical phenomenon, such as heatwaves, or floods that will occurr with a probability that is appropriately set with respect to your level of sustainability awareness.
